# myWebTA - Helpful tools for teachers

Classroom utility belt made from AngularJS and Twitter Bootstrap and running on Google App Engine.

I'm kinda just putting this here to learn git and have a place to host the files, but if you'd like to contribute, feel free.

This might also be an ok template for anyone looking to build an Angular/Bootstrap/GAE app I guess.

Also, the JsonHandler is a pretty cool custom RequestHandler class for webapp2.
